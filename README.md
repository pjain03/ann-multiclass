### DESCRIPTION:
Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network implementation to classify data
into multiple classes (2 or more). 
1. We take a dataset and the number of classes to classify into, and process the
dataset into hot-encoded labels. (05/10/18)

### DATASETS:
1. [Iris](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/)

### PACKAGES:
pickle

### INSTRUCTIONS:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. python scripts/process.py

### RESOURCES:
1. A [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBv09BD7ez_4Bs9j3o8l_ZTjQZoN_3Oqs) by Professor Victor Lavrenko of University of Edinburgh
explaining many key concepts.
> [A fact pointed out here that I thought was pretty cool was that we could
represent ANY binary problem with a Neural Network of 1 hidden layer given
x neurons in the input layer correspond to 2 ^ x layers in the hidden layer
simply because that encoded all possible combinations of values of input!
